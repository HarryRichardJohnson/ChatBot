# ChatBot

This is a colaboritive project between students at AUT

AI-based ChatBot that can answer student questions in 
a natural conversation style (written or voice). The hope is that this will free up the student 
advisers for the more valuable responsibilities they have. Students should be able to interact 
with the ChatBot online and on a mobile device.
